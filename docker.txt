Why my application does not work on other machine?
1. One or more files missing(Not fully deployed)
2. Software version mismatch(python3 needed, but python2 running!)
3. Different configuration settings(env variables are different across this machine)

Container - An isolated environment for running an application

Differences between container and virtual machines(abstraction of a machine(physical hardware))

Problems of virtual machines:
1. Each VM needs a full-blown OS
2. Slow to start
3. Resource intensive(CPU, Memory, etc.)

Benefits of Containers:
1. Allow running mulltiple apps in isolation
2. Are lightweight(Don't nee full OS)
3. Use OS of the host
4. Start quickly
5. Need less hardware resources(less CPU, less Memory)
